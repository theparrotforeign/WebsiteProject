<div><h2>Unit 1 Outcome 2</h2></div>
<div><p><b>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code,Trello</b></p>
<p>I was a complete novice using Visual Studio Code and Trello having never used either of them before and remain an enthusiastic amatuer, with regards to Visual Studio Code at least. I feel I have improved greatly however and have grasped many of its elements and concepts. Working on the project and running into difficulties has left me with a greater understanding of VSC and though I am aware of many more options and facets that can be added to a website using VSC I fear I will have to forgo them due to time constraints. Visual Studio Code is of course free which aligned perfectly with the projects’ budget and seems accessible and easy to use. For the majority of the project I had VSC full page and would often get frustrated when looking up references or checking course material, I realised unfortunately late on that I could type the code whilst it was in a window saving a lot of time and effort.</p>

<p>Trello has proved a useful organisational tool and my usage of it has changed as the project has progressed. I now try to keep the titles of cards more general or encompassing for example “Unit 1 Outcome 2” and then apply the relevant work done or being done in comments e.g. “2.1”, rather than have a plethora of tasks in the doing tab. I believe this approach is more suited to individual projects as in group endeavors team members might wish to have their individual cards.</p>
<p><b>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</b></p>
<p>As stated in 2.1 the fact that Visual Studio Code was free made it very appropriate for use with the project however my lack of experience with it did hold me back, though I feel I have learned a great deal from the progress and mistakes I made. Trello was a helpful tool of organisation again and I did vary how I used it towards the project's final stages, becoming more efficient. The various features and shortcuts on VSC such as providing suggestions when code is being typed such as <p></p> with the next text entry being added in the appropriate place in the element when a p is typed made it very appropriate for use in completing this project. Trello was indeed helpful as were other people’s questions and solutions on Slack but on the whole I feel Trello is more appropriate or used to its full strength in team projects.In individual projects updating or managing Trello can distract or disrupt momentum when progress is being made but it was clearly a necessity to use it in this instance.
</p>
<p><b>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</b></p>
<p>On the whole I am not happy with the end result of my website. It is my first attempt at building one though and the first time I have used the available tools to that end. I was unsure of a theme and it would have been advantageous for me to know more about HTML before the task was set, this would of course defeat the object of the task. I know writing this now that I will not have time to use any Flexbox applications so my website will most likely be mundane and disjointed. It is for this reason that I chose the David Shirgley images as his work often portrays frustrations, fears and observations with light dark humour and I hope I get to properly size the images. I believe this could be viewed as a strength as I believe his observations on life and society fit well with challenges I faced throughout the task. I believe I will have a functioning website with all the necessary information on it by the tasks’ completion. 
</p>
<p>I would have liked to have been able to make the site easier to navigate with more pages and better links on the home page.</p>
<p><b>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project
</b></p>
<p>With infinite time, money and coding knowledge there would be no limit to the possibilities. I would certainly tidy the site up using more varied elements, perhaps organise the questions differently. It would be good to have a video playing in the background, gifs and possibly sound as well in the form of music or sound effects when you make an option choice. If all legal guidelines were met it could prove financially advantageous to host adverts, though these generally are infuriating and severely detrimental to the users experience. I would admit also that with more time and a better understanding of the tools and necessary coding knowledge I would have planned the project far better at the beginning and if I attempt a similar project in the future I am aware of which parts are important, what eats up time and what is most important to focus on.
</p>
<p><b>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</b></p>
<p>I did plan and create my website, choosing a consistent theme of the artwork of David Shirgley and kept varying though alternative for each page headings and titles the same size, having the same element. I appear to have my files stored effectively all in one root file, though I did lose my homepage midway through the project having to redo it, making me extra vigilant in such matters going forward.

<div><h2>Unit 1 Outcome 3</h2></div>
<div><p><b>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</b></p>
<p>On the whole I can say I definitely could have been more efficient making the website. I feel I worried too much about what the theme was to begin with and spent too much time on things that could’ve warranted less of my attention. My inexperience led to much inefficiency where code or work I had spent precious time on simply had to be abandoned or redone. There was even an incident where I lost an entire page that had taken me most of the time I had spent on the project to do. On the first day of the project my laptop and only PC I have access to became inoperable wasting the whole day and though I was able to absorb some of the lessons I feel that time was never recovered and I was rushing and/or panicking from that moment, it also greatly affected me having a clear picture of where I was going with the task going forward, and I was always catching up missing vital information. I did eventually however manage to find a fix to the problem and also ordered a new laptop, the arranging of which was also time wasted and energy spent concerning that instead of the website and the new code I was learning. The importance of reliable good quality hardware is clearly illustrated here.</p>
<p>As stated previously for an individual project Trello can still be a useful organisational tool but has the drawback of slowing progress and momentum when you feel you are finally getting somewhere. I would have liked to have released earlier that it's possible to enter code into VSC when it's in a window, not the full page so as to better use helpful sites and course materials. In a certain aspect this task could’ve been more efficiently and productively carried out were it a team project. Team members would be able to share their ideas on Slack, or through Zoom, compare code, help each other out and pool resources. Different team members would have varying strengths and weaknesses and their combined knowledge of coding would present more options and spot more mistakes or aspects that need changing.</p>
<p><b>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</b></p>
<p>It is important to take breaks from the screen every once in a while to keep productivity and efficiency high. A stressful problem often won’t be overcome getting frustrated by it, it's important to be calm and relax, have a clear mind and try to take another perspective from those that may be failing you.</p>
<p>To this end activities like Yoga and personal fitness training can put you in the right mindset to try and tackle the problem again or continue with the task. I believe I slept the best I had in a long time after participating in the Yoga class on the first Tuesday of the course, which isn’t something I would usually do and I believe it certainly did me good and made me more productive.
</p>
<p><b>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</b></p>
<p>I would definitely have a better idea of what it's important to decipher i.e plan before attempting the task. I would have a more complicated idea of how a user would navigate the site with more options to engage them. I would ensure my hardware was not in risk of failing stopping all progress. In a team project scenario Trello would be used more effectively obviously keeping everyone up to date with what they’re doing, why they’re doing it, what it will lead to and when it needs to be done. A team project would have different members with their varying strengths and weaknesses able to pool their resources using tools like Zoom, Slack and Trello, combining their strengths and negating possible weaknesses and lack of coding experience. The workload would be shared making time constraints less demanding.</p>
<p><b>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</b></p>
<p>Digital solutions would be tested, obviously by users. As we did with the Python project each team in the group shared their finished games and received feedback from the other teams, implementing changes where necessary. In the case of a website you get fellow group members or acquaintances with or without a background in IT and design  to visit it, ask them for feedback or share images on Slack to see what people think. It is also the case that during the project you are constantly running the file through your browser to see what effects have taken place or if the code has the desired effect.</p></div>
