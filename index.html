<div class="About"><h2><b>About Me</b></h2></div>
<div><p>I am a graduate who is keenly interested in politics and the mechanisms and forces that increasingly influence our society towards what would seem a certain and not necessarily desirable objective. The power of certain actors seems to be completely unchallenged and the monetisation of social interaction another market that leads to mass misinformation among the general populous with an end to increasing the influence and control of the powerful. It is for this reason I believe it is imperative to have an interest in technology and all systems of control  so as to better understand and resist them where possible.</p></div>

<p>I didn’t know what to expect from the course and found it a bit daunting at first but I knew going in there would be people with more experience of coding than me. I certainly felt it was something I should have some knowledge about. I definitely feel I have learnt alot and things I earlier would’ve struggled with now won’t present a significant problem. I have enjoyed the challenge and people have been accommodating and helpful. My knowledge of remote office applications and other vital tools has improved considerably and it's good to be doing something in a slightly different field.
